# Practice and In-Darkness Code Base

### This is the place where reside the following :
- Failed Projects
- Unstarted Project Ideas - lack of skills
- Other miscellaneous code sandbox things like experimenting and learning the various libraries and frameworks.

> ### Does it contain everything?
> No, it doesn't. <br> 
> Even though there are various projects present in this and a lot of practicing stuff, it is only 20% of the original content. The purpose of cleaning it regularly is to take care of the good project ideas not be be burdened with intense amount of useless code and scratch.

> ### Why this repo on github?
> Because I want to keep all my files and progress transparent to my programming family. Yes it includes you as well :)

> Don't miss the README.md files present in each sub repo of this grand repo.
